# dihedral-newforms d'apr√®s Samuele Anni and Peter Bruin

This implements algorithms by Samuele Anni and Peter Bruin to find newforms of dihedral Galois image, and runs them to find such dimension-2 newforms with dihedral image at primes above 7.

Run `find_dihedral.sage' to get the forms as done in the paper.
